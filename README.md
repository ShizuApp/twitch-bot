# Twitch-Bot
SUMMARY:
Customizable bot to run commands and administrate streams in twitch.tv.
This project is completely built using python 3.
It used twitchio (thitch.tv's API) to connect with the client.

HOW TO INSTALL:
As now this version of the client needs a config.ini file with the
twitch client URL (the account's token) and a list of the channels in order to run.

In future versions, client and custom commands will be available via a UI 
through the project's website.
